# DiveLog
A a mid-fidelity prototype of the mobile application for snorkelers and amateur scuba divers.


The basic brief:
1) It should enable users to take photos and videos of their underwater experiences and view them later when back on land or boat
2) track and view details of their diving activity (e.g. monitoring their (current) depth, ascent time, air left in tank,
duration of the dive etc.)
3) The user should be able to browse and view their photos, videos and details for each dive or snorkel activity taken (dive log with additional photos and videos) on their mobile app.
